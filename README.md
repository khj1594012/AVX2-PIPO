# FF1-AVX2-PIPO

This is an implementation of AVX2-PIPO applied to the encryption function of FF1.

This experiment was performed on an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS virtual machine with Intel i5-8250U CPU @2.50GHz and 2GB RAM.

The ff1.c file in the FF1-AVX2-PIPO/src directory contains both an implementation for AVX2-PIPO and an implementation for FF1-AVX2-PIPO.
